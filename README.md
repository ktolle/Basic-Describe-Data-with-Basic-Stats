# Basic-Data-Visualization-with-Pandas-Dataframes

This is a notebook that gives you the ability to visually interogate your data and evaluate the independent variables against the dependent variable using a simple classification dataset--the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data). 

We'll start by looking at the data correlation and skew. Then we will roll into looking at the data through visualization. 

Univariate
* Histograms
* Density
* Box-plots
* Scatter charts

Multivariate
* Correlation matrix
* Scatter matrix

Not all of these techniques work for this dataset, but it's worth showing why or why not.
